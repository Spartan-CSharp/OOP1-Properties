# OOP1-Properties
The homework from the Lesson 4, Properties, of Module 4, Object-Oriented Programming, Part 1, of the Complete Foundation in C# Course Series from Tim Corey. We are to create a Class that has Properties for street address, city, state, and zip code. Then add a FullAddress property that is read-only.
